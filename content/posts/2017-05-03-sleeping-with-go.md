Sleeping, or waiting in Go, is part of the [time package][1]. It's a very simple process, all you need to do is specify the duration to sleep for, which in this case is a number followed by it's unit, so `2*time.Second` means 2 seconds. This will sleep the current goroutine so other go routines will continue to run.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Printf("Current Unix Time: %v\n", time.Now().Unix())

    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)

    fmt.Printf("Current Unix Time: %v\n", time.Now().Unix())
}
```

And here's what it looks like:
