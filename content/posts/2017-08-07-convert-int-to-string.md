This is a short example on how to convert an integer number into a string. This is a common use case when printing to screen or working with the number as if it was a string. To do this we use the `strconv` package and the `Itoa` function.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strconv"
)

func main() {
    // Will print Number: 1234
    anInt := 1234
    fmt.Println("Number: " + strconv.Itoa(anInt))
}
```
